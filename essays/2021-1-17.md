title: Why I Chose MIS

I have always had an interest in electronics and liked math, and until a had got to college I imagined that this interest would point me into the direction to engineering. 
After my first year at UH I changed my major to pursue a degree in Finance.
If I was being honest, making money was always a main priority for me and being able to learn ways to do that fascinated me. One prerequisite for a business major is ICS 101, 
and the end module for this class is about basic coding in html and web design. 
I would say that the end portion of ICS 101 was the most fun I have had while taking a course in a long time. 
After having a conversation with a cousin, who graduated a couple of years ago, they had told me they graduated with an MIS degree. 
While asking them what MIS was about, they had told me that it would be primarily deal with html and web design. 
I began looking into the MIS major and felt that it would be a good fit for me. 
I also believe that having a degree in MIS would open the door for more career opportunities.
I hope to learn a lot from this class and my time throughout my journey in pursuing a degree in MIS
